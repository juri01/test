# Spring MVC 5.1.18 example

This project demonstrates a minimal Spring MVC application packaged as a WAR and integrates [springdoc-openapi-ui](https://springdoc.org/) for automatic Swagger documentation.

Build the project with Maven:

```bash
mvn -q package
```

Run on an application server such as Tomcat and access the Swagger UI at `/swagger-ui.html`.
